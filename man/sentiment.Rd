\usage{
sentiment(text.var, polarity_dt = lexicon::hash_sentiment_jockers_rinker,
  valence_shifters_dt = lexicon::hash_valence_shifters, hyphen = "",
  amplifier.weight = 0.8, n.before = 5, n.after = 2,
  question.weight = 1, adversative.weight = 0.25,
  neutral.nonverb.like = FALSE, missing_value = 0, comma_handler = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{text.var}{The text variable.  Can be a \code{get_sentences} object or
a raw character vector though \code{get_sentences} is preferred as it avoids
the repeated cost of doing sentence boundary disambiguation every time
\code{sentiment} is run.}

\item{polarity_dt}{A \pkg{data.table} of positive/negative words and
weights with x and y as column names.  The \pkg{lexicon} package has several 
dictionaries that can be used, including: 
\itemize{
  \item \code{lexicon::hash_sentiment_jockers_rinker}
  \item \code{lexicon::hash_sentiment_jockers}
  \item \code{lexicon::emojis_sentiment}
  \item \code{lexicon::hash_sentiment_emojis}
  \item \code{lexicon::hash_sentiment_huliu}
  \item \code{lexicon::hash_sentiment_loughran_mcdonald}
  \item \code{lexicon::hash_sentiment_nrc}
  \item \code{lexicon::hash_sentiment_senticnet}
  \item \code{lexicon::hash_sentiment_sentiword}
  \item \code{lexicon::hash_sentiment_slangsd}
  \item \code{lexicon::hash_sentiment_socal_google}
}
Additionally, the 
\code{as_key} function can be used to make a sentiment frame suitable for
\code{polarity_dt}.  This takes a 2 column data.frame with the first column
being words and the second column being polarity values.  Note that as of 
version 1.0.0 \pkg{sentimentr} switched from the Liu & HU (2004) dictionary
as the default to Jocker's (2017) dictionary from the \pkg{syuzhet} package.
Use \code{lexicon::hash_sentiment_huliu} to obtain the old behavior.}

\item{valence_shifters_dt}{A \pkg{data.table} of valence shifters that
can alter a polarized word's meaning and an integer key for negators (1),
amplifiers [intensifiers] (2), de-amplifiers [downtoners] (3) and adversative 
conjunctions (4) with x and y as column names.}

\item{hyphen}{The character string to replace hyphens with.  Default replaces
with nothing so 'sugar-free' becomes 'sugarfree'.  Setting \code{hyphen = " "}
would result in a space between words (e.g., 'sugar free').  Typically use 
either " " or default "".}

\item{amplifier.weight}{The weight to apply to amplifiers/de-amplifiers 
[intensifiers/downtoners] (values from 0 to 1).  This value will multiply the 
polarized terms by 1 + this value.}

\item{n.before}{The number of words to consider as valence shifters before
the polarized word.  To consider the entire beginning portion of a sentence
use \code{n.before = Inf}.}

\item{n.after}{The number of words to consider as valence shifters after
the polarized word.  To consider the entire ending portion of a sentence
use \code{n.after = Inf}.}

\item{question.weight}{The weighting of questions (values from 0 to 1).
Default is 1.  A 0 corresponds with the belief that questions (pure questions)
are not polarized.  A weight may be applied based on the evidence that the
questions function with polarized sentiment.  In an opinion tasks such as a
course evalaution the questions are more likely polarized, not designed to
gain information.  On the other hand, in a setting with more natural dialogue,
the question is less likely polarized and is likely to function as a means
to gather information.}

\item{adversative.weight}{The weight to give to adversative conjunctions or 
contrasting conjunctions (e.g., "but") that overrule the previous clause 
(Halliday & Hasan, 2013).  Weighting a contrasting statement stems from the 
belief that the adversative conjunctions like "but", "however", and "although" 
amplify the current clause and/or down weight the prior clause.  If an 
adversative conjunction is located before the polarized word in the context 
cluster the cluster is up-weighted 1 + number of occurrences of the 
adversative conjunctions before the polarized word times the
weight given (\eqn{1 + N_{adversative\,conjunctions} * z_2} where \eqn{z_2} 
is the \code{adversative.weight}).  Conversely, an adversative conjunction 
found after the polarized word in a context cluster down weights the cluster 
1 - number of occurrences of the adversative conjunctions after the polarized 
word times the weight given (\eqn{1 + N_{adversative\,conjunctions}*-1 * z_2}).  
These are added to the deamplifier and amplifier weights and thus the down 
weight is constrained to -1 as the lower bound.  Set to zero to remove 
adversative conjunction weighting.}

\item{neutral.nonverb.like}{logical.  If \code{TRUE}, and 'like' is found
in the \code{polarity_dt}, when the word 'like' is preceded by one of the 
following linking verbs: \code{"'s"}, \code{"was"}, \code{"is"}, \code{"has"}, 
\code{"am"}, \code{"are"}, \code{"'re"}, \code{"had"}, or \code{"been"} it is 
neutralized as this non-verb form of like is not likely polarized.  This is a 
poor man's part of speech tagger, maintaining the balance between speed and 
accuracy.  The word 'like', as a verb, tends to be polarized and is usually 
preceded by a noun or pronoun, not one of the linking verbs above.  This 
hyper parameter doesn't always yield improved results depending on the context 
of where the text data comes from.  For example, it is likely to be more 
useful in literary works, where like is often used in non-verb form, than 
product comments.  Use of this parameter will add compute time, this must be 
weighed against the need for accuracy and the likeliness that more accurate 
results will come from setting this argument to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{missing_value}{A value to replace \code{NA}/\code{NaN} with.  Use
\code{NULL} to retain missing values.}

\item{comma_handler}{If \code{TRUE}, removes commas before valence shifters.}
  
  
\item{\ldots}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
Returns a \pkg{data.table} of:
\itemize{
  \item  element_id - The id number of the original vector passed to \code{sentiment}
  \item  sentence_id - The id number of the sentences within each \code{element_id}
  \item  word_count - Word count
  \item  sentiment - Sentiment/polarity score
}

\description{
Approximate the sentiment (polarity) of text by sentence.  This function allows
the user to easily alter (add, change, replace) the default polarity an 
valence shifters dictionaries to suit the context dependent needs of a particular
data set.  See the \code{polarity_dt} and \code{valence_shifters_dt} arguments
for more information.  Other hyper-parameters may add additional fine tuned 
control of the algorithm that may boost performance in different contexts.
}
\details{
The equation used by the algorithm to assign value to polarity of
each sentence fist utilizes the sentiment dictionary to tag polarized words.  
Each paragraph
(\eqn{p_i = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\}}{p_i = \{s_1, s_2, ... s_n\}}) composed of
sentences, is broken into element sentences
(\eqn{s_i,j = \{w_1, w_2, ..., w_n\}}{s_i,j = \{w_1, w_2, ... w_n\}}) where \eqn{w}
are the words within sentences.  Each sentence (\eqn{s_j}) is broken into a
an ordered bag of words.  Punctuation is removed with the exception of pause
punctuations (commas, colons, semicolons) which are considered a word within
the sentence.  I will denote pause words as \eqn{cw} (comma words) for
convenience.  We can represent these words as an i,j,k notation as
\eqn{w_{i,j,k}}.  For example \eqn{w_{3,2,5}} would be the fifth word of the
second sentence of the third paragraph.  While I use the term paragraph this
merely represent a complete turn of talk.  For example t may be a cell level
response in a questionnaire composed of sentences.

The words in each sentence (\eqn{w_{i,j,k}}) are searched and compared to a
dictionary of polarized words (e.g., Jockers (2017) dictionary found in 
the \pkg{lexicon} package).  Positive (\eqn{w_{i,j,k}^{+}}{w_i,j,k^+}) and
 negative (\eqn{w_{i,j,k}^{-}}{w_i,j,k^-}) words are tagged with a \eqn{+1} 
 and \eqn{-1} respectively.  I will denote polarized words as \eqn{pw} for 
 convenience. These will form a polar cluster (\eqn{c_{i,j,l}}{c_i,j,l}) 
 which is a subset of the a sentence 
 (\eqn{c_{i,j,l} \subseteq s_i,j }{l_i,j,l \subseteq s_i,j}).

The polarized context cluster (\eqn{c_{i,j,l}}) of words is pulled from around
the polarized word (\eqn{pw}) and defaults to 4 words before and two words
after \eqn{pw}) to be considered as valence shifters.  The cluster can be represented as
(\eqn{c_{i,j,l} = \{pw_{i,j,k - nb}, ..., pw_{i,j,k} , ..., pw_{i,j,k - na}\}}{c_i,j,l = \{pw_i,j,k - nb, ..., pw_i,j,k , ..., pw_i,j,k - na\}}),
where \eqn{nb} & \eqn{na} are the parameters \code{n.before} and \code{n.after}
set by the user.  The words in this polarized context cluster are tagged as
neutral (\eqn{w_{i,j,k}^{0}}{w_i,j,k^0}), negator (\eqn{w_{i,j,k}^{n}}{w_i,j,k^n}),
amplifier [intensifier]] (\eqn{w_{i,j,k}^{a}}{w_i,j,k^a}), or de-amplifier
[downtoner] (\eqn{w_{i,j,k}^{d}}{w_i,j,k^d}). Neutral words hold no value in 
the equation but do affect word count (\eqn{n}).  Each polarized word is then 
weighted (\eqn{w}) based on the weights from the \code{polarity_dt} argument 
and then further weighted by the function and number of the valence shifters 
directly surrounding the positive or negative word (\eqn{pw}).  Pause 
(\eqn{cw}) locations (punctuation that denotes a pause including commas, 
colons, and semicolons) are indexed and considered in calculating the upper 
and lower bounds in the polarized context cluster. This is because these marks 
indicate a change in thought and words prior are not necessarily connected 
with words after these punctuation marks.  The lower bound of the polarized 
context cluster is constrained to 
\eqn{\max \{pw_{i,j,k - nb}, 1, \max \{cw_{i,j,k} < pw_{i,j,k}\}\}} and the upper bound is
constrained to \eqn{\min \{pw_{i,j,k + na}, w_{i,jn}, \min \{cw_{i,j,k} > pw_{i,j,k}\}\}}
where \eqn{w_{i,jn}} is the number of words in the sentence.

The core value in the cluster, the polarized word is acted upon by valence
shifters. Amplifiers (intensifiers) increase the polarity by 1.8 (.8 is the default weight
(\eqn{z})).  Amplifiers (\eqn{w_{i,j,k}^{a}}) become de-amplifiers if the context
cluster contains an odd number of negators (\eqn{w_{i,j,k}^{n}}).  De-amplifiers
(downtoners) work to decrease the polarity.  Negation (\eqn{w_{i,j,k}^{n}}) acts on
amplifiers/de-amplifiers as discussed but also flip the sign of the polarized
word.  Negation is determined by raising -1 to the power of the number of
negators (\eqn{w_{i,j,k}^{n}}) + 2.  Simply, this is a result of a belief that two
negatives equal a positive, 3 negatives a negative and so on.

The adversative conjunctions (i.e., 'but', 'however', and 'although') also 
weight the context cluster.  A adversative conjunction before the polarized 
word (\eqn{w_{adversative\,conjunction}, ..., w_{i, j, k}^{p}}) up-weights 
the cluster by 
\eqn{1 + z_2 * \{|w_{adversative\,conjunction}|, ..., w_{i, j, k}^{p}\}} 
(.85 is the default weight (\eqn{z_2})).  An adversative conjunction after 
the polarized word down-weights the cluster by
\eqn{1 + \{w_{i, j, k}^{p}, ..., |w_{adversative\,conjunction}| * -1\} * z_2}.  
The number of occurrences before and after the polarized word are multiplied by
1 and -1 respectively and then summed within context cluster.  It is this
value that is multiplied by the weight and added to 1. This
corresponds to the belief that an adversative conjunction makes the next 
clause of greater values while lowering the value placed on the prior clause.

The researcher may provide a weight \eqn{z} to be utilized with
amplifiers/de-amplifiers (default is .8; de-amplifier weight is constrained
to -1 lower bound).  Last, these weighted context clusters (\eqn{c_{i,j,l}}{c_i,j,l}) are
summed (\eqn{c'_{i,j}}{c'_i,j}) and divided by the square root of the word count (\eqn{\sqrt{w_{i,jn}}}{\sqrtn w_i,jn}) yielding an \strong{unbounded
polarity score} (\eqn{\delta}{C}) for each sentence.

\deqn{\delta=\frac{c'_{i,j}}{\sqrt{w_{i,jn}}}}{C=c'_i,j,l/\sqrt(w_i,jn)}

Where:

\deqn{c'_{i,j}=\sum{((1 + w_{amp} + w_{deamp})\cdot w_{i,j,k}^{p}(-1)^{2 + w_{neg}})}}

\deqn{w_{amp}= (w_{b} > 1) + \sum{(w_{neg}\cdot (z \cdot w_{i,j,k}^{a}))}}

\deqn{w_{deamp} = \max(w_{deamp'}, -1)}

\deqn{w_{deamp'}= (w_{b} < 1) + \sum{(z(- w_{neg}\cdot w_{i,j,k}^{a} + w_{i,j,k}^{d}))}}

\deqn{w_{b} = 1 + z_2 * w_{b'}}

\deqn{w_{b'} = \sum{\\(|w_{adversative\,conjunction}|, ..., w_{i, j, k}^{p}, w_{i, j, k}^{p}, ..., |w_{adversative\,conjunction}| * -1}\\)}

\deqn{w_{neg}= \left(\sum{w_{i,j,k}^{n}}\right) \bmod {2}}
}
\note{
The polarity score is dependent upon the polarity dictionary used.
This function defaults to a combined and augmented version of Jocker's (2017) 
[originally exported by the \pkg{syuzhet} package] & Rinker's augmented Hu & Liu (2004) 
dictionaries in the \pkg{lexicon} package, however, this may not be appropriate, for 
example, in the context of children in a classroom.  The user may (is 
encouraged) to provide/augment the dictionary (see the \code{as_key} 
function).  For instance the word "sick" in a high school setting may mean 
that something is good, whereas "sick" used by a typical adult indicates 
something is not right or negative connotation (\strong{deixis}).
